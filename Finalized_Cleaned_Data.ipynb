Aloft, a strong and compact upper wave moved across portions of Kansas during the afternoon. While most severe weather outcomes were expected further north of the WFO Norman area, a few supercell thunderstorms developed along a trailing dryline near the 100th meridian. This included a powerful supercell thunderstorm that moved from Hemphill County, Texas (WFO Amarillo, Texas) into portions of Roger Mills/Custer/Washita/Blaine/Canadian/Oklahoma counties during the afternoon into late evening hours. This thunderstorm was responsible for thirteen (13) tornadoes, including significant tornadoes west of Custer City and near Yukon, Oklahoma.

A total of 11 tornadoes touched down in Illinois. There were 11 tornadoes in total across the NWS Chicago area of responsibility, which is the most in a February event since official NWS tornado records began in 1950. In addition to the tornadoes, the storms produced numerous instances of severe hail and damaging straight-line wind.   \n",

              "1150126  A major, negatively tilted and closed upper trough rotated through the mid-south and southeast U.S. on March 1st.  A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.

              "1150127  A major, negatively tilted and closed upper trough rotated through the mid-south and southeast U.S. on March 1st.  A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.

The tornado moved northeastward through eastern sections of The Glen subdivision, producing sporadic tree damage. As the tornado crossed Barrington Road near Mundhank Road, significant tree damage occurred, with numerous branches and trunks snapped. The tornado continued northeast toward Willow Creek Church, where it uprooted at least one tree and damaged metal bus shelters. Damage became less severe as the tornado neared Algonquin Road, but increased again as the tornado turned to the east toward Whispering Trails Drive and Huntington Boulevard in Hoffman Estates. Damage was noted to residences along Chesapeake Court, Fir Court, and Crimson Drive with two residences losing a significant amount of roofing material. Other homes in the neighborhood had shingle damage, and a window was damaged at another residence. Tree damage, including broken limbs, was also observed. Roofing material removed from a home on Fir Court was deposited to the northwest, with plywood impaled into the ground and other debris penetrating the wall of a house, ending up in its living room.

The tornado then tracked northeastward and ended along the Alabama River, east of the Whites Bluff community.  The most concentrated damage in Dallas County occurred just south of Five Points along County Road 31 and along County Road 33.

              "1150127  A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Georgia concluded that the EF3 tornado that first touched down in southeast Webster county continued to track northeast from the southwest to the northeast corner of Sumter county and then continued into extreme southern Macon county before finally lifting.  The tornado tracked a total distance on the ground of approximately 40 miles.  The tornado entered Sumter county about 4.75 miles southwest of Plains in southwest Sumter county and exited the northeast part of the county about 9 miles north of Methvins in northeast Sumter county.  This was by far the most violent and devastating tornado of the March 1st outbreak.  The tornado tracked roughly 32 miles across Sumter county with a maximum path width of 1.0 mile wide, which occurred in the Americus area.  Damage within the city of Americus was extensive, although structures, trees, and power lines were down along the entire path of the tornado.  The most significant damage in Americus was to the Sumter Regional Hospital, of which a significant portion was destroyed.  Hundreds of homes and businesses in the Americus area were either totally destroyed or sustained significant damage.  Hunderds of vehicles were also damaged or destroyed by debris and/or tossed about like matchsticks.  The majority of the damage was within the vicinity of the Sumter Regional Hospital.  Two deaths were reported at a home in Americus when a wall collapsed on a 43 year-old male and a 53-year old female.  At least eight injuries were documented, but there may have been more.||Within the city of Americus, proper, there were 1235 total structures damaged or destroyed, including 217 businesses, 993 residences, 3 cemeteries, 10 churches, 1 fire station, 1 hospital, 8 recreational facilities/parks, and 2 schools.  There were 75 structures (42 businesses, 31 residences, 1 hospital, 1 church) were destroyed.

The tornado eventually lifted just east of US Highway 231 near the Carters Hill community.  Two of the injuries occurred when an automobile was thrown off the road over 300 feet.  In all at least 39 homes suffered varying degrees of damage.  Three of the homes were completely destroyed.  At least 23 out-buildings or barns were damaged. Five large chicken houses were completely obliterated near the Davenport community.  One high voltage power transmission line was totally destroyed.  Fourteen grain silos were destroyed.  Four of the grain silos were picked up and thrown up to one half of a mile away from where they were anchored.  At least 10 automobiles were significantly damaged.  Hundreds of trees were snapped off or uprooted along the damage path.  \n",

The tornado continued northeast toward Willow Creek Church, where it uprooted at least one tree and damaged metal bus shelters. Damage became less severe as the tornado neared Algonquin Road, but increased again as the tornado turned to the east toward Whispering Trails Drive and Huntington Boulevard in Hoffman Estates. Damage was noted to residences along Chesapeake Court, Fir Court, and Crimson Drive with two residences losing a significant amount of roofing material. Other homes in the neighborhood had shingle damage, and a window was damaged at another residence. Tree damage, including broken limbs, was also observed. Roofing material removed from a home on Fir Court was deposited to the northwest, with plywood impaled into the ground and other debris penetrating the wall of a house, ending up in its living room. The tornado dissipated near Crimson Drive in Hoffman Estates.</td>\n",
